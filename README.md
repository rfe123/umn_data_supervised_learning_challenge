# umn_data_supervised_learning_challenge
Module 20 - Supervised Machine Learning

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
